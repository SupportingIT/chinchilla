Well, this is a RabbitMQ library to help \r\nyou be more awesome with RabbitMQ when you need to be awesome, which is every day.\r\n\r\nShow me the goods\r\n=================\r\n \r\n    // connect to a rabbitmq server\r\n\tvar bus = Depot.Connect(\"server\")\r\n\r\n    // publish a message\r\n    bus.Publish(new HelloWorldMessage());\r\n\r\n\t// publish a lot of messages\r\n\tusing (var publisher = bus.CreatePublisher<HelloWorldMessage>())\r\n    {\r\n\t\t// this will use a publisher dedicated to this message type\r\n\t\tpublisher.Publish(new HelloWorldMessage());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\t// subscribe to messages\r\n\tbus.Subscribe((HelloWorldMessage message) => { Console.WriteLine(\"WOAH!\") });\r\n\r\n\t// subscribe with a message consumer\r\n\tbus.Subscribe(new HelloWorldMessageConsumer());\r\n\r\n\t// subscribe and process messages with a number of workers\r\n\tbus.Subscribe((HelloWorldMessage message) => {}, \r\n\t\to => o.DeliverUsing<WorkerPoolDeliveryStrategy>(s => s.NumWorkers = 5));\r\n\r\n\t// subscribe and process messages on the task factory\r\n\tbus.Subscribe((HelloWorldMessage message) => {}, \r\n\t\to => o.DeliverUsing<TaskDeliveryStrategy>());\r\n\r\nSamples?\r\n========\r\n\r\nThere are a few samples available that show off some of the features of Chinchilla.\r\n\r\nAlternatives choices?\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of fantastic RabbitMQ libraries out there and you should evaluate\r\neach and every one of them before making a choice. I suggest looking at:\r\n\r\n* EasyNetQ (http://easynetq.com/)\r\n* MassTransit (http://masstransit-project.com/)\r\n* Burrow.NET (https://github.com/vanthoainguyen/Burrow.NET)\r\n* RabbitBus (https://github.com/derekgreer/rabbitBus)\r\n\r\nEach one is slightly different, and depending on your needs might fit your requirements better."}
